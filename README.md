# MomazosDiego.exe
A joke virus that not afect to your PC. When you open it, a text box will appear for a few seconds, and the Diego momazos will chase you. Every time they touch the mouse, one more will be added, up to ten. After that, it'll all be over.
You can close it with the task manager and it won't hurt anything.
